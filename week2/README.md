# Functions and Scope

At the end of Day 5:

* You will be able to:
	* write functions to perform arbitrary encapsulated procedures
	* use common built in functions of Python

* You will understand:
	* function declaration syntax, including:
		* how to pass arguments
		* how to name and access parameters
		* default parameter values
		* scope
	* how integrate the previous course materials into functions

At the end of Day 6:

* You will be able to:
	* apply what we have learned to:
		* break problems down into parts
		* implement those parts into functions that work together
* You will understand:
	* the greater purpose of what we covered in the previous classes

# Object Oriented Programming

The next three evenings will be based on object oriented programming.  This will essentially incorporate much of what we have done over the last few weeks.  However, we will be thinking about all of this information in a form known as classes.

For days 7 through 9, we will be focusing on Object Oriented Programming (OOP),

At the end of Day 7:

* You will be able to:
	* write a simple class definition
	* access attributes and methods on classes

* You will understand:
	* attributes and methods
	* the difference between an instance and class

At the end of Day 8:

* You will be able to:
	* identify circumstances to use classes
	* use magic methods to make more complicated classes
* You will understand:
	* magic method overriding
	* how everything in Python is an object and why it matters
