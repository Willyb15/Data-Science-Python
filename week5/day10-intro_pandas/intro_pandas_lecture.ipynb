    "# Intro to Pandas \n",
    "\n",
    "Tonight we're going to be starting our journey through the Pandas library (created by Wes McKinney). When we refer to working in Pandas, we're typically talking about working within a dataframe, which is what we'll focus on tonight. We'll be diving into Pandas DataFrames, which are objects that will hold our data, allowing us to interact with it, manipulate it, and eventually throw it into machine learning algorithms (if we want). \n",
    "\n",
    "Since a Pandas DataFrame is an **object**, this means is that we're going to interact with it in much the same way that we interact with all of our other objects in python. Before we get to actually interacting with DataFrames, though, we'll have to get one, and get one with data in it! There's one quick step that we have to do before that... \n",

    "## Pandas Import \n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "import pandas as pd # Standard import. \n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Here I've shown how we get access to everything in the Pandas library - we import it! Also note that I placed the python comment `\"# Standard import\"` out to the right of our import. This was to note that this is the standard way to import the Pandas library. You should be sure that if you are importing the entire pandas library, you follow this syntax. It's common practice to use `pd` as the alias, and we tend to follow common practice whenever possible. This makes it easier for others to read your code."

    "## Getting a DataFrame Object\n",
    "\n",
    "There are two basic ways that we can get a Pandas DataFrame object to work with. The first is by using data that is already in our Python program, in conjuction with the `DataFrame` constructor. The second is by reading in external data through the pandas module (which remembered we've imported and made accessible via `pd`). For reference, here are the [docs](http://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/stable/generated/pandas.DataFrame.html) for Pandas DataFrames. \n",

    "##### Using data already in our Python program\n",
    "\n",
    "If we are using data that is already in our Python program, then we are going to be passing that data to the `DataFrame` constructor. We typically do this in one of two ways. The first involves passing in a list of dictionaries, whereas the second involves passing in two lists. Let's dive into the first..."

    "Each and every one of our Pandas DataFrames will consist of **rows** and **columns**, where the columns will be denoted and accessed via their names, and the rows will be denoted and access via the indices of the DataFrame. Above, we can look at our columns and see that their names are `a`, `b`, `c`, and `d`. We can similiary look at our rows and see that they are indexed by `0` and `1`. These column names and indices are how we will access this data later. How did the `DataFrame` constructor take our list of dictionaries and put it into the DataFrame in that format, though?\n",
    "\n",
    "When the Pandas DataFrame encounters a list of dictionaries like we gave it, it interprets each dictionary to be a row in the DataFrame. The keys are read as the column names and the values as the values for each column. By default, the DataFrame constructor will assign a column for **every** key that it sees in **any** dictionary in the list of dictionaries. If a particular dictionary in that list doesn't have a value for that key, then it assigns a `NaN` (stands for not a number) value for that index-column pair. Therefore, when the Pandas DataFrame above got the list of dictionaries, it saw `a`, `b`, `c`, and `d` keys, and thus created those columns. It then filled in the values associated with those keys, filling in a `NaN` if it didn't find that key (like it didn't find `d` in the first dictionary in our list). "

    "#### Reading External Data\n",
    "\n",
    "There are many ways that we can read external data into a Pandas DataFrame, and they will be called as a function that is available via the `pandas` module. As a result of importing the `pandas` module and making it accessible via `pd`, this means that we will call all of these functions via `pd`. Each one of these functions will **return** back to us a Pandas DataFrame object, populated with the external data that we read in. \n",
    "\n",
    "The [Pandas documentation](http://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/stable/io.html) will show you all of the ways that you could load external data into a DataFrame. Basically, there is a way to load in data stored in any format (CSV, JSON, SQL, Excel, HTML). All of these take some form of a `read_{data_type}` function, which means that we will call them as `pd.read_{data_type}`.\n",
    "\n",
    "So, if we wanted to load data in from a CSV, we would simply use:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "df = pd.read_csv('my_data.csv')\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Note: This assumes that you have the column names in the first row of your .csv.\n",
    "\n",
    "If you don't have the column names in the first row of your .csv, you could read in the .csv with the following:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "df = pd.read_csv('my_data.csv', header=None)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Note: This by default assigns numbers as the column names (starting with 0).\n",
    "\n",
    "If you wanted to assign the column names as you read it in, you can pass in an additional `names` argument, where this `names` argument holds a list of the names you want to assign to the columns.\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "df = pd.read_csv('my_data.csv', header=None, names=['col1', 'col2', ...., 'col12'])\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "I have showed above a couple of the parameters that you can pass arguments to when reading in data. Just note that the functions that are available to read in data from other sources will likely also have optional parameters that you can specify. "

We have four methods that are availiable on our dataframe for getting a general sense of our data: `info()`, `describe()`, `head()`, and `tail()`. Let's take a look at what these do. "

If you want to grab entire rows or columns, then you can use bracket notation to do that (just like we use bracket notation to index into lists). If we want an entire column, then we're going to place the **column name** in brackets (and multiple column names in a list inside those brackets). We can also sometimes access a column via dot notation on the dataframe, which we'll show in a second. If we want an entire row, then we have to place **both** a **beginning and ending index** inside the brackets (it won't work to just place a single index in the brackets). "

Note that these are **methods**, which means that we will call them via dot notation on our dataframe object. The difference between these three has to do with how we use them. `loc[]` is a purely label-location based indexer, `iloc[]` is a purely integer-location based indexer, and `ix[]` is a primarily label-location based indexer that falls back to integer indexing.\n",

We're going to look at a couple of more things tonight, but to view all available attributes and methods of DataFrames, you can check out the [Pandas Docs](http://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/stable/generated/pandas.DataFrame.html). If you want practical examples of how you might use DataFrames, I might suggest getting a copy of [Python for Data Analysis](http://shop.oreilly.com/product/0636920023784.do) (it's written by Wes McKinney, the creator of Pandas).\n",

Dropping columns is done using the `drop()` method on the Pandas DataFrame. When dropping columns, you have to be careful to make sure to tell the DataFrame to drop them in place, or assign the DataFrame with dropped columns to a new variable. You also need to make sure to tell the `drop()` method what axis the thing you're trying to drop is on (rows are `axis=0`, and columns are `axis=1`)."

To fill nulls, we use the `.fillna()` method on the DataFrame, and to drop nulls, we call the `.dropna()` method on the DataFrame. In terms of the `.fillna()` function, we can give it a default value to fill in, or a number of other methods to fill it in (padding, back filling, foward filling). You can read about dealing with missing data in the docs [here](http://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/stable/missing_data.html#cleaning-filling-missing-data). We're not going to go into too much depth here, but want you to know that this functionality exists. "

    "You might have noticed that in a couple of places, when we asked for certain rows/columns of the data, we got back a 1-D array that had an index attached. These are examples of what Pandas calls `Series`. In the documentation for [Pandas Series](http://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/version/0.15.2/dsintro.html#series), you can get an idea of what they can do. For the most part, we can kind of treat them like a mini DataFrame, as they have a lot of the same methods. However, there are some slight differences.

    "## A quick look at vizualization in Pandas\n",
    "\n",
    "There are numerous libraries available in Python for creating vizualizations. Often times, you will probably find yourself using [Seaborn](http://stanford.edu/~mwaskom/software/seaborn/) and/or [Matplotlib](http://matplotlib.org/) for anything that is general purpose, and then other libraries if you need something more specialized ([Plotly](https://plot.ly/) for dashboards, for example). All of these libraries allow you to build great looking visualizations that can be used in a production setting. If you want something quick and dirty to visualize your data very easily, there is also some plotting functionality built into Pandas. \n",
    "\n",
    "If we look at the [docs](http://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/version/0.15.0/visualization.html#other-plots), we can see that the plotting available with Pandas will be called via the `plot()` method on a DataFrame object. From there, we'll pass in a bunch of potential arguments to the `plot()` method to specify exactly how to build the plot. The most important of those arguments is the `kind` keyword argument, which tells the `plot()` method what kind of visualization you would like (bar plot, histogram, scatter plot, etc.). Tonight we'll look at one or two examples - since most of the time you'll be doing your visualization in Seaborn or Matplotlib, we'll just give you a taste of what Pandas can do so that you know it's there. We'll look at Seaborn and Matplotlib in a little bit more depth in a later class. "
