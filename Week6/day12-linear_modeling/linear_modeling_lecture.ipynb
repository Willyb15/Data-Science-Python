    "# Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "For the past week you have been learning about new Python libraries: `Numpy` and `Pandas`. Up until now we haven't talked too much about what makes these libraries useful. Yeah, `Numpy` is good for vectorizing computations, and `Pandas` is good for loading and manipulating data; but are those tasks ends, in and of themselves, or means to an end? \n",
    "\n",
    "The answer, as with many of our answers, is, it depends. So far you've seen both libraries used independent of any particular task. Tonight that changes. Tonight we will use these libraries in efforts to accomplish the same end as [Pinky and the Brain](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pinky_and_the_Brain)! Ok, maybe be won't be trying to take over the world (...or will we?), but we will be working on just as lofty an endeavour: predicting the unknown.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Types of Learning\n",
    "\n",
    "In the realm of Data Science we talk about two distinct types of learning from data, [supervised](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Supervised_learning) and [unsupervised](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unsupervised_learning). There are other sub-classes of these two types of learning, but for the most part any data science pursuit can be classified into one of these two. **Unsupervised learning** consists of trying to find unapparent structure in your data that holds meaningful information. Today we are going to be focusing on **supervised learning**, though. This brand of learning attempts to build a model that predicts a target outcome from known inputs. This is accomplished through the use of inputs with correct targets to train the model. For example, if I'm trying to predict whether or not there will be a traffic jam on the highway. Data to solve this problem might have inputs such as the day of the week, the time of day, whether or not it's a holiday, if there is a major event going on that day, etc; and a target of traffic jam or not. Once the model is trained, we'll get to how to do this soon, I can then predict if there's going to be a traffic jam or not by plugging in the the desired inputs to the model. \n",
    "\n",
    "This was an example of what is known as a **binary classification** problem, the binary comes from deciding yes or no on traffic jam. Binary is just the simplest case of **classification problems**, though. Classification problems can tackle problems where you are trying to predict if inputs cause something to be in any of `n` classes. We will look at an example of this later with the iris data set.\n",
    "\n",
    "We don't always just want to classify something as a target for our predictions, though. Frequently we want predict how much of something will happen based on inputs. This type of problem is know as **regression**. An example of this is trying to predict the price of a stock at the end of a day based on how the market behaved that day. Here we aren't trying to classify the stock into a group but instead want a prediction for it's price, these values can take on any number on the real line, technically.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Types of Models\n",
    "\n",
    "Today we are going to get a taste for both classification and regession problems. The models that we're going to use in the examples are linear models, logistic and linear regression. These might sound simplistic, but they are far from it. Both of these types of models are the grand parents of statistical models and are a great place to start your journey towards learning about the great wide world of modeling. In addition, we will be using the `sklearn` library, this library has models that go well beyond the realm of linear. And because of polymorphism of classes they way that you will interact with those model classes will be very similar, in essence, to what you see in lecture today. Almost universally, there is both a `regression` and a `classification` version of the models found in `sklearn`. So, much of what you learn today will be applicable in a much larger scope than you may currently realize."

    "# Classification Problems\n",
    "\n",
    "As mentioned above, classification problems enter us into a realm where we want to predict what class something is in based on some inputs. To accomplish this we are going to want some data. Thank goodness we know how to load that stuff up. We are going to be working with the famous [iris](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iris_flower_data_set) data set today. It is located in the `sklearn.datasets` module. Let's take a look at it now. The data sets in `sklearn` have a description associated with them, let's look at that and the shape of the data."

Frequently we'd want to more EDA, but since that isn't the subject of today's lecture we're going to move on to the one that is, modeling. To try and predict the class of an unknown flower with known measurement we are going to use logistic regression. This is a standard linear based model used for classification problems. We are going to import the [logistic regression](http://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.linear_model.LogisticRegression.html) model from `sklearn` then feed our features and associated labels to an instance of it via the `fit()` method."
