    "Wikipedia defines an object as the following:\n",
    "\n",
    "* In computer science, an object can be a variable, a data structure, a function, or a method, and as such, is a location in memory having a value and referenced by an identifier.\n",
    "\n",
    "* In the class-based object-oriented programming paradigm, \"object\" refers to a particular instance of a class where the object can be a combination of variables, functions, and data structures.\n",
    "\n",
    "The former definition should be fairly familiar to you, even if you haven't heard the term \"object\" before.  The variables and data structures you create are stored away in memory somewhere and you - the lucky Python programmer - don't have to worry about any of those details."
